# Finstagram

Here are Flatiron School, whether you attend the campus to learn or learn online, community is what holds all of us together.  I created Finstagram for Learners to post their favorite photos and to get to know one another in a small yet fun way.  If you're a Learner pass this on to other Learners and let's have fun with coding.

## Running Finstagram on your terminal

1. Fork and clone Finstagram locally
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `shotgun`
4. Click the link given for the IP address or localhost to begin playing with Finstagram

## Happy Coding
